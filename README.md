I use this repository to look into the less well documented or plainly obscure corners of the GitHub ecosystem. I have no intention whatsoever of maintaining whatever I dump into this repository. I reserve the right to force push to the main branch with no regard for other clones or forks. You have been warned!

**Please excuse the mess**
